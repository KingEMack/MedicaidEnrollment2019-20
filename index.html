            In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the urge for New Yorkers to have a health insurance plan is more important than ever. The map below illustrates the percentage change of New York State Medicaid Enrollment data from September 2019 and
            September 2020. The county with the highest increases ranges from 7-13% with Saratoga being the highest. New Yorkers who have lost their job and health insurance appear to be a factor in the increase</p>

          <p> “When I lost my position as a flight attendant with Jet Blue Airlines, I also lost my health insurance. It was devasting at first, but fortunately, I was able to apply for both unemployment and Medicaid,” said Letoya Henry, Queens
            Native. Although Henry’s experience may resonate with other New Yorkers, this just reveals one aspect of the increase of the recent Medicaid enrollment. </p>
